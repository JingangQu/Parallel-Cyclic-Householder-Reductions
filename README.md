# Parallel-Cyclic-Householder-Reductions
Parallel cyclic reduction (PCR) is an alternative method to Thomas algorithm for the resolution of tridiagonal linear systems. It is stable for diagonally dominant matrices or symmetric and positive definite matrices.  I will realize it on GPUs by using Cuda.
