# Parallel Cyclic and Householder Reductions
Parallel cyclic reduction (PCR) is an alternative method to Thomas algorithm for the resolution of tridiagonal linear systems. It is stable for diagonally dominant matrices or symmetric and positive definite matrices.  I will realize it on GPUs by using Cuda.

I have compiled the cuda file, and the exe file is included in the codes folder. You can get the result by running it directly.
